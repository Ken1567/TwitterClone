        Expressing yourself can help you keep in touch with how you are feeling.
        <br />
        It can also help you release a lot of tension that you might be carrying
        around. <br />
        Everyone needs some time alone to reflect on feelings. <br />
        Being able to express how you feel might help you make better decisions
        about what is right for you now.
